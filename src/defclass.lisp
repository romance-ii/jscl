;;; This  file  defines  object   classes  and  instances  incompletely.
;;; The  intent is  to provide  a  useful subset  of CLOS  functionality
;;; without actually providing any  “wrong” details. That is: everything
;;; here should either work as ANSI CL requires, or not work at all, but
;;; (hopefully) nothing should be “wrong,” per se.

;;; Implementation-wise: A  class metaobject  contains a  layout pointer
;;; which provides  its mapping  of direct slots  and references  to its
;;; superclasses. See  SLOT-VALUE for a practical  example of navigating
;;; these structures. They are  implemented as storage-vector objects at
;;; the JavaScript level.

;; A Class-Layout  structure contains the interesting  information about
;; the  current revision  of a  class.  An instance  object's slots  are
;; organized in the order given in  the class layout, with all inherited
;; slots preceding all direct slots.
